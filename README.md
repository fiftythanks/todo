# To-Do List (or a Pomodoro Timer)
This to-do list/pomodoro timer was made as an assignment from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-todo-list).

The application has the following features:
- A [pomodoro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) timer.
- A task list where each task is assigned an amount of tomatoes to finish it. As soon as a user spends that amount of tomatoes doing the task, it automatically finishes.
- A progress section that shows the overall amount of tomatoes for the entire list of tasks, how many tomatoes have already been spent doing tasks from the list and how much time is left (including breaks, except the last one) to finish the list.
- A button to add a new task.
- Settings:
  - Tomato duration
  - Short break duration
  - Long break duration
  - Automatically finish tasks
  - Automatically switch to breaks
- To be continued ...
